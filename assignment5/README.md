## Assignment 5

First of all I ran the following commands to update the list of package and then upgrade them.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```

After that, I ran the following command to install OpenVas.

```bash
apt-get install openvas
```

Then I setted up OpenVas as followed.

```bash
openvas-setup
```

Let's create a new user:

```bash
openvas-stop
openvasmd --create-user=john --password=john --role=Admin
openvas-start
```

Finally, I synchronized the vulnerability data to OpenVAS:

```bash
greenbone-nvt-sync
greenbone-scapdata-sync
greenbone-certdata-sync
```
